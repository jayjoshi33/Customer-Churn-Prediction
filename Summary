# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. A Random Forest classifier was employed, and the project was deployed using Flask with API endpoints for making predictions.

## Key Points

### Approaches Tried:
1. **MinMaxScaler vs Standard Scaler**: StandardScaler provided better results.
2. **Scoring (Accuracy vs Recall)**: Accuracy scoring during grid search yielded better results.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Dividing age into bins as a feature engineering step led to worse results.

### Novelty of the Project:
- **Deployment**: The model was deployed using a Flask application, with endpoints created for API usage.
- **API Testing**: The API was successfully tested with Postman, accepting inputs in JSON format.
- **Outlier Removal**: By removing some outliers, the model's accuracy increased by 2%.
- **Performance**: The Random Forest model achieved **86% accuracy** and **50% recall**, while the null accuracy was **79%**.
  
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Important features identified: `Age`, `Geography`, `Gender`, `NumOfProducts`. This was confirmed during the modeling phase.
