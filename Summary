Project Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning. I used a Decision Tree classifier and deployed the model with Flask, creating API endpoints for making predictions.

Key Highlights

Methods Used:

Scaling Methods: I tested both MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler,StandardScaler gave better results.
Accuracy vs Recall: During grid search, optimizing for accuracy gave better overall performance than recall.
Feature Engineering: I tried dividing the Age feature into bins, but this reduced the model’s performance.

Unique Aspects of the Project:

Model Deployment: The model was deployed using a Flask app with API endpoints for real-time predictions.
API Testing: The API was tested using Postman, with inputs provided in JSON format.
Outlier Removal: By removing some outliers, I improved the model’s accuracy by 2%.
Performance: The Random Forest model achieved 87% accuracy and 49% recall. The baseline (null) accuracy was 80%.
To further improve recall, I used undersampling by removing 3,000 instances of non-churn customers (output=0). This helped reduce model bias and a Decision Tree model with undersampling achieved 82% accuracy and 60% recall, compared to the null accuracy of 79%.
I also tried oversampling using SMOTE which achieved 84% accuracy and 68% recall, compared to the null accuracy of 79%.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Key features that influenced churn: Age, Geography, Balance, and NumOfProducts. These features were confirmed to be important during the modeling phase.
